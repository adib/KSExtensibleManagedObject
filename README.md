Features
========

`KSExtensibleManagedObject` extends `NSManagedObject` to support dictionary-like storage of non-modelled properties. This is particularly useful in situations where you want to extend your managed object model slightly, but can't or don't want to perform a migration of existing persistent stores.

Questions about the code should be left as issues at https://github.com/karelia/KSExtensibleManagedObject or message me on Twitter.

Dependencies
============

* No library dependencies beyond Core Data
* Works back to OS X v10.5.
* **BUT**, support for KSExtensibleManagedObject **MUST** be baked into your managed object model **BEFORE** shipping; see Usage below for full details

Usage
=====

When designing your managed object model, for any entities that you think you might want extensible property support for in the future, add an extra `data` attribute. By default `KSExtensibleManagedObject` assumes this attribute is named `extensiblePropertiesData`, so you likely want to match that. But if not, override `+extensiblePropertiesDataKey` to supply your own name.

Note that so far, you haven't needed the `KSExtensibleManagedObject` class itself. When/if you *do* require its functionality:

1. Add `KSExtensibleManagedObject.h` and `KSExtensibleManagedObject.m` to your project. Ideally, make this repo a submodule, but hey, it's your codebase, do whatever you feel like.
2. Make `KSExtensibleManagedObject` the superclass of your custom managed object's class
3. Call `-setExtensibleProperty:forKey:` or `-removeExtensiblePropertyForKey:` to modify the extensible property storage. Note that values must adopt `NSCoding` to be stored
4. Use `-extensiblePropertyForKey:` and `extensibleProperties` to retrieve values

You can go further if desired and turn on KVC and KVO (Key Value Observing/Coding) support for non-modelled keys by overriding `-usesExtensiblePropertiesForUndefinedKey:` in your custom subclass.

See the `KSExtensibleManagedObject.h` for a few other possibly helpful advanced goodies.
